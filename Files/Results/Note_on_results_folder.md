# Note on generated results
Plots and intermediary results (like preprocessed sessions) will be exported into this folder. Note that all export generating scripts assume that a respective export folder is already present in the results folder. We create examples of these dedicated folders for PreAnalysis scripts but users have to create those manually for actual analysis script before executing these scripts. The naming schema to follow is that the script 'dimsSpikeMoveI_2ndPopulation.py' in the folder 'Dimensions' would need an empty folder created with the path 'Files/Results/Dimensions/dimsSpikeMoveI_2ndPopulation' where 'Files' is the respective folder from the GitHub repository.
